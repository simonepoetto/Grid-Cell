Mechanistic models account for hexagonal grids as the result of pattern-forming dynamics in a recurrent neural network with hand tuned center-surround connectivity
Normative models show the emergence of grid-cells from a neural architecture trained to solve a navigational task, due to the constraints of solving this task.
This work reproduces the results from different normative models and provides a theoretical unification of the two approaches.

Virtual rat model (from 10.1111/j.1460-9568.2012.08015.x.):
The rat uses first order motion dynamics, i.e. constant speed and no acceleration. It can detect and avoid obstacles by a limited line-of-sight mechanism: the rat's direction is obstructed if an obstacle is closer than 2 cm to his position, otherwise the direction is free. The virtual rat has two possible behaviors: exploration and target seeking. During exploration the rat iteratively picks random transient waypoints inside is line-of-sight area. The speed of the virtual rat throughout the navigation is constant at 20 cm/s except during the
forward linear look-ahead trajectory probes during which the virtual rat is stationary. The virtual rat performs a full scan of forward linear look-ahead trajectory
probes after every 4 cm of travel.
